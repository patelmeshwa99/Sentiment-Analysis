Sentiment Analysis on imdb dataset

1) The main project is of SENTIMENT ANALYSIS on textual data(imdb dataset - a dataset that contains 25000 movie reviews and their sentiments i.e positive/negative) using neural network with file name Sentiment_Analysis_Final_Project.ipynb. In order to predict input reviews, an encoder function is also created which will convert the provided input to the input feasible for created model. For output values from nearly 0.35-0.65, you can consider reviews as neutral.

2) I have also done small projects of sentiment analysis on twitter dataset with different implementations.
